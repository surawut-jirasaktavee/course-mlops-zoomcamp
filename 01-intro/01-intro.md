## Three Stage in a Machine Learning Project
---

MLOps is a set of practices of putting machine learning in production.
It's consist of 3 stages

- **Design**: In this stage we have to considering the problem/thinking to decide that we need machine learning to help to achieve the objective or we can use only rule-based.
- **Train**: After the brainstorm till you can finalized the way you will go. If that way is a machine learning, let's train the model. so you do the following step:
  - Training the model on the training set
  - Optimize the model performance on the validation set
- **Operate**: This final stage for captures the performance of the model that you got and you were deployed it to the production. the reason why we should to capture or monitor is below:
  - the performance of the model had degrades
  - reproducible
  - easier to train the model
  - easier to deploy the model
