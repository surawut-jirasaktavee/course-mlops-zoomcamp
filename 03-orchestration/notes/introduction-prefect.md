# Introducing Prefect

**Eliminating Negative Engineering**

- Open-source workflow orchestration
- Python-based
- Modern data stack
- Native Dask integration
- Very active community
- Prefect Cloud/Prefect Server
- Prefect Orion(2.0) 

**Prefect Orion** is the massive change/update from `Prefect Core(1.0`). because `Prefect Core` didn't support `Dag` in the workflow.

**Prefect Core(1.0)** requires the user to define a **static graph(DAG)** that must to specify in advance all the possible steps your workflow can take at runtime, with help of triggers.

**Prefect Orion(2.0)** is more **dynamic and minimally invasive** in python code. The latter means that just make minimal changes to code in order to build the workflow on top of it. 

- Embracing dynamic, DAG-free workflows
- An extraordinary developer
- Transparent and observable orchestration rules
