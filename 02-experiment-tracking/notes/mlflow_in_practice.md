## MLFLOW Scenario 3

### Different scenarios for running MLflow

- A single data scientist participating in an ML competition or project.
- A cross-functional team with one data scientist working with on an ML model
- Multiple data scientists working on multiple ML models

Depends on the scenario that we can figure out MLflow in different context.

### Configuring MLflow

- Backend store
    - local filesystem
    - SQLAlchemy compatible DB (e.g. SQLite)
- Artificats store
    - local filesystem
    - remote (e.g. s3 bucket)
- Tracking server
